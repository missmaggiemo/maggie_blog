JSON feed, RSS feed?

Cache blog posts front page so that DB only gets queried after post.

Truncate long blog posts on index page.

Encrypt cookies for user with bcrypt?



*User profile link if signed in-- dropdown menu for site and for user options.*

*add ability to see all posts in a category*

Set up blog: model for posts, url for each post, "next" button for successive posts, categories (1 per post), email post to myself when I submit it, should have posting terminal and I should be the only person able to post (password to post? url w/out links on site? users for site?)

later: should be able to search for a post via key words?
