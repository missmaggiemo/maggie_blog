#TODO

Fix header and footer links.

User profile link if signed in-- dropdown menu for site and for user options.


*blog.missmaggiemo.com sub-domin, added as CNAME-- new rails project for blog, new Heroku*

*email every post submitted to admin@missmaggiemo.com*

*add ability to see all posts in a category*

Set up blog: model for posts, url for each post, "next" button for successive posts, categories (1 per post), email post to myself when I submit it, should have posting terminal and I should be the only person able to post (password to post? url w/out links on site? users for site?)

later: should be able to search for a post via key words?

blog.missmaggiemo.com?
missmaggiemo.com/blog?
